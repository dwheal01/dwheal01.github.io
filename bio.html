                <h1>Biography</h1>
                    <p>
                    	I was born in Washington D.C. on September 29th,
                    	1997. From the years 2002-2008 I attended Rock
                    	Creek Forest Elementary School (a language
                    	immersion school) where I learned Spanish. Within
                    	these years I learned to swim, ice skate, ski,
                    	and play tennis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	From the years 2008-2011 I attended Westland 
                    	Middle school. During this time I learned to
                    	ride horses, began to travel the world, and
                    	started to discover my strength in math and 
                    	science. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	2011-2015 were my High School Years. I went to 
                    	Bethesda Chevey Chase High School. Here I was
                    	a member of the Girls Varsity Tennis Team and the
                    	Mock Trial Team. I took my first physics class
                    	which inspired me to become an engineer.
                    </p>
                	<p>
                		In 2015 I started my college education at Tufts
                		University. I declared a major in Electrical 
                		Engineering my first year, and soon after declared
                		a minor in computer science. I joined the Tufts
                		Ski Racing Team and Studied abroad in Talloires
                		France. 
                	</p>
                	<p>
                		I am not a senior, set to graduate with May, 2019.
                		This summer I will be moving to San Diego, CA to 
                		work as a Software Engineer at Qualcomm.
